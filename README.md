# simple_calculator
How it Works: Main Window (root): The application window is created using tk.Tk().

Entry Widget: A tk.Entry widget is used for the user to input numbers and see results.

Button Widgets: Each button is a tk.Button widget with a command to handle user input.

Numeric buttons and operators append their value to the entry field.

The C button clears the entry.

The = button evaluates the expression using the eval() function.

Grid Layout: The grid() method arranges buttons in a grid.

Features:

Handles basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Displays "Error" for invalid expressions (e.g., division by zero or malformed input).

Clears input with the C button.

Run the script, and you'll see a fully functional calculator GUI.
